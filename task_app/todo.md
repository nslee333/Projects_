Basic idea:
    - MERN stack.
    - Basic todo app.
        - Two sections: Todo and completed tasks.
        - Daily.

[Design][Bugs]:
- Authentication?
    - Login with google?

[Completed-Tasks]:
1. Initialize a database for task app - collection for tasks.


[Tasks]:
2. Set up express server side.
3. Write up task and submit to database.
    3.1: Write a function to take the input, then add a document to the task_app database.
    3.2: On 'Enter' key press it is submitted.
4. On first load, it needs to load the active tasks.
    - Under useEffect function.

5. When a task is marked completed - it is deleted from the database?





[CT]: On enter key press submit to mongoDB.
